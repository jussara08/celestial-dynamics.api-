# Feedback

## Round 1

Remaining feedback is marked with "SABINA COMMENT" in the `-feedback.ipynb` notebook.

### Notebook
- Remember to add hashtags (#) to create sections in your notebook. I see you organized it, which is nice, but if you add the headings you can also collapse the code underneath.
- Would split your code into multiple notebooks, one for data collection, one for data cleaning, one for visualizations, etc. You can also split by the topic/celestial body if you want but right now the notebook is difficult to read and needs some restructuring. Left specific comments in the notebook.
- Make sure to add your thoughts in each notebook! If you come back to this in 2-3 weeks you will forget what were the main points!
- Pro-tip: Add Key takeaways at the beginning of each analysis notebook, it will help you further down the line in remembering all you did.

### Repo
- Need to add the data files!

### README

- Data Cleaning & Processing section is not needed here.
- You can use the VSCode preview function to check that README files show up the way you expect them to. When I look at the Data Visualizations section I see a big blob of text instead of multiple points:
> NEO (Asteroids) Histogram of asteroid sizes Scatter: relative velocity vs miss distance Frequency of hazardous vs non-hazardous NEOs DONKI (Solar Weather) Line chart of geomagnetic storm Kp index over time CME speed distribution Heatmap of Kp intensity Cross-Event Comparisons CME speed vs resulting geomagnetic storm strength Event timelines combining FLR, CME, and GST
- Would rename Data Visualizations to Insights and replace the chart titles with the insights you also added in your presentation. Make sure to add the charts here too.
- Would put the hypotheses into the insights.
- Would move the Datasets used section at the end.

Readability improvements
- Try to use "#" and "##" to create headings/subheadings, it will make your README more organized.
- Use bulletpoints (marked with "-" or "*") to showcase ideas.
